<!-- FUNDAMENTALS OF ERS: -->
</strong>
    - In the first of the three modules that make up the course we will examine the physics and technology behind acquiring images from a spacecraft or other platform. This will lead us to understand something about the atmosphere and how substances on the earth surface reflect or emit electromagnetic radiation in different ranges of wavelengths. We will also look at the types of distortions that can occur in the images during the recording process and how we can take steps to correct those errors. Towards the end of the module we will think about how we can analyze images, that will set us up for a more in depth treatment in the next two modules. In the second and third modules, we examine means by which we can analyze and therefore extract information from the corrected recorded image data. This will take us into the field of machine learning. Module two will present the background theory to the various machine learning techniques that have been applied for remote sensing image data. There are two parts for module three, in the first half the module two material is placed in the context of sets of practical considerations. The second half of the third module provides a treatment of the use of radar technology for remote sensing purposes. We will illustrate each of the modules with examples and applications. Remember, the course is designed with a number of self assessments and tests built in so that you can check your understanding as you work through the material to be presented.
    - There are many websites that you may wish to look at to supplement the treatment in this course, particularly to see examples of remote sensing images and their applications. At various stages during the presentation some will be recommended. Although there is no prescribed textbook for the course, much of the material is based on the two books listed here. Please note the permission granted by Springer to use diagrams from the books in this course is gratefully acknowledged. Please note that the diagrams cannot be reused without permission from Springer or other identified copyright owners.
    - This is a serious course in remote sensing involving concepts from physics and mathematics. While we have limited the depth of the mathematics as much as possible, a proper understanding of some topics, particularly in module two, is not possible without a mathematical description. And knowledge of calculus, statistics, and vector, and matrix algebra is especially useful for appreciating much of that material. However, there are no mathematical derivations in the assessable material, although there are a few questions in which some formulas need to be described. If you are not strong mathematically, it should still be possible for you to cope with most of the quizzes and the tests for credit.
    - The material in this course has been used in many ways over a number of years in courses of instruction where many of the participants had been from Earth science backgrounds and not from physics or engineering. The manner in which the material is developed is sensitive to those types of student by ensuring that careful explanations are given, accompanied by hand calculations, examples and summaries. A document is provided for you to use with each module that lists in text form the words spoken at each slide, that should help you with overcoming problems with my accent, which may be very different from your own. It would be good to use that material extensively by watching a slide, pausing the presentation, and reading the text, and re-watching the slide if necessary.
    - Remote sensing is a wonderfully exciting field, combining the best aspects of space technology, computer applications, images, and the natural world. It brings together scientists, geologists, engineers, geographers, hydrologists, foresters, surveyors, agronomists, and just about any professional who is engaged in the environment in one way or another. That's what makes it so good, it is a truly interdisciplinary endeavor.
