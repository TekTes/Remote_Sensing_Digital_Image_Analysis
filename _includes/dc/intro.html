  <b>Course Introduction:</b>

   The focus of the course is going to be the field of remote sensing, which is the technology for recording and using images of portions of the Earth surface. By analyzing and interpreting those images we can gain an understanding of how the region is used and managed, how it changes with time, and how natural features are distributed. Remote sensing images are also used for mineral exploration, crop and forest monitoring, and for tracking large scale floods and wildfires. In short, it is a technology with an enormous range of Earth science and related applications. The field commenced with the taking of air photographs in various wavelength ranges back in the 1960s, but progressed very quickly in the 1970s to the recording of images from satellite platforms. Satellites give a greater field of view and can be arranged in orbit such that the whole of the Earth's surface can be imaged in a given time period. This is a first course on remote sensing. It covers how images of the Earth's surface are acquired, and methods that are used to interpret those images. It has an emphasis on how the technology is applied in practice. Although it is in some ways an introduction to remote sensing, it is not just an overview course. It develops and presents the material in sufficient depth so that your understanding on completion should be sufficient for you to enter the field professionally and to undertake more advanced treatments.  </p>

    <b>Course Duration and Assessments:</b>
    The course is designed around three five-week modules. Each week will have four or five lectures, requiring about 12 to 15 minutes each of your time. Together this means each module consists of about five hours of lecture time, giving 15 hours total for the course. If you are doing the course for credit, then your total weekly workload should be about 6 hours. At the end of each lecture there is a short self-checking quiz. Answers are provided so that you can monitor your understanding as the course progresses. Those quiz questions do not form part of the course assessment, if you are doing it for credit. At the end of each week there is a multiple choice quiz. And at the end of each of the three modules there is a test. To receive credit for a module you have to perform satisfactorily in the quizzes and the test.
