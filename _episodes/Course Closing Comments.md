## Course Closing Comments

You have now completed all three modules of the course, and hopefully you have undertaken the quizzes and tests too. As a result, you should now be familiar with optical and radar remote sensing imaging technologies and have an appreciation of how they're used in practice. You should also have a good appreciation of the major methods for image analysis that are used in remote sensing, particularly for optical data. That includes both supervised and unsupervised approaches. If you are interested in pursuing radar remote sensing further, you will find that it has its own analytical methods as well. Methods that exploit the special nature of radar images and what they tell us about the landscape. You are now in the position to pursue a second more advanced course in the theory and technologies of remote sensing or a more in-depth treatment of machine learning, and artificial intelligence procedures if they are of interest to you. More particularly though, you can focus in detail on a particular application domain. Developing application specific knowledge in remote sensing by building on the treatment in this course, following, you will find some suggestions I've made for further reading. I wish you well in your endeavors, and trust you enjoy applying the tools and techniques of remote sensing in your own field.
