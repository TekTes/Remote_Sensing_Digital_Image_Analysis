### Welcome to Module 2

We now come to module 2, which is key to understanding how to interpret images in remote sensing. In this module, we treat image analysis in depth. It is the most mathematical of all three modules. If your background is not mathematical, please don't be discouraged from working through the material. We step through it carefully and provide surrounding commentary so that, even if the mathematics challenges you, you should still understand what we're doing and appreciate the outcome. The module builds on the material of module 1. In particular, it starts with the assumption that images have been recorded of regions of the earth's surface that are of interest to us, and that any errors in those images have been corrected. It is based on the model of the spectral space. That is the fundamental descriptor of the image data that is used throughout all remote sensing image analysis. At the end of this module, you should understand first, the steps of training and classification, supervised classification, the concept of the thematic map, and then the maximum likelihood classifier, the minimum distance classifier, the support vector machine, and the neural network. We will then spend time on the convolutional neural network and deep learning, which is the most recent technique. We then finalize the module by talking about clustering with examples from unsupervised classification.
