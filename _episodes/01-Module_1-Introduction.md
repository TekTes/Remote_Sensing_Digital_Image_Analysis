# Remote Sensing Image Acquisition, Analysis and Applications

### Welcome to Module 1

Welcome to the first of the three modules that make up this course on remote sensing. This is our foundation module. Here we will introduce the field of remote sensing based, as it is, on acquiring images of the Earth's surface, mostly from space. 

We will see how that is done and what the images look like, and how we represent them. We will also examine how the presence of the Earth's atmosphere affects the images recorded. 

Our ultimate course goal is to know how to analyze images so we can gather information about the landscape being imaged. In this module, we will introduce how we go about that analysis, in preparation for what is to come in the next two modules. 

At the end of this module, we meet one of the most significant image processing tools in the field. It is called principal components analysis; it arises time and again throughout our course and is the first time we encounter some mathematical development. While that may be foreign to some of you, it is important that you at least understand the fundamental ideas, since they underpin some of our later material.

> 1. CCD array sensors tend to have higher spatial and spectral resolution than those based on scanning 
> mirrors.  Why?

> 2. With  aircraft systems, why is IFOV a more  meaningful term than pixel size? Has it to do with the
